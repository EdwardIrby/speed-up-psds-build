## Font family

<Badge color="yellow">New</Badge>

Pluralsight's font family for the web is a custom font called PS TT Commons.

We no longer use the Gotham font from typography.com. You should remove any remaining references to that. As we are transitioning, Gotham is still listed as a fallback font. Eventually it will be fully removed.

Internally, we are using a [variable font](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fonts/Variable_Fonts_Guide) to provide all weights programmatically. This should drastically reduce the number of network requests and overall page weight dedicated to fonts. IE 11 does not support variable fonts, and IE users will get the `sans-serif` fallback.

<FontFamily />

The `@font-face` declaration is included in the normalize stylesheet. Install with:

```bash
npm install @pluralsight/ps-design-system-normalize
```

Then include it in your global stylesheet:

```css
@import '@pluralsight/ps-design-system-normalize';
```

## CDN reference

The normalize stylesheet should be used in most cases. But if you need a direct reference to the font file, it is located at:

```
https://fonts.pluralsight.com/ps-tt-commons/v1/ps-tt-commons-variable-roman.woff2
```

## Domain-restricted access

The CDN reference used by the Normalize stylesheet is domain-restricted. In other words, only requests coming from enumerated domains will succeed. If you have a new domain that you require new font access on, please contact #platform-ui in Slack.

## Font weight

10 font weights are available.

<FontWeight />

To apply the font weights, use the vars in css:

```css
@import "@pluralsight/ps-design-system-core";

.mySelector { font-weight: var(--psTypeFontWeightBold); }`}
```

## Font size

Eight font sizes are available.

<FontSize />

To apply the font sizes, use the vars in css:

```css
@import '@pluralsight/ps-design-system-core';

.mySelector {
  font-size: var(--psTypeFontSizeLarge);
}
```

## Line height

Four line height increments are available. Each font size also has a default line height.

<LineHeight />

```css
@import '@pluralsight/ps-design-system-core';

.mySelector {
  line-height: var(--psTypeLineHeightStandard);
}
```

## Monospace font

Pluralsightâ€™s monospace font family for the web is [DM Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Mono).

<MonospaceGlyphs />

To use the DM Mono on your site, you can install it by importing it from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Mono).

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" />
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=DM+Mono:wght@400;500&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```
